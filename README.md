Goal of this repo is check Bradley Berg's hash tables for probable prime tests.


###### Sep, 2020
Take Bradley's [hash](https://www.techneon.com/) tables and
[psps-below-2-to-64.txt.bz2](http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/Pseudoprimes/index-2-to-64.html) file and check
all the 11M numbers for false alarms of the composit check.


Having fun is the only price.
